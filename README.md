[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/aeklundh-enterprises/Heroes%20Randomiser/_apis/build/status/Heroes%20Randomiser?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/aeklundh-enterprises/Heroes%20Randomiser/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

Heroes Randomiser is a (pseudo-)randomiser for [Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.com/) team compositions. It's intended to make semi-viable teams for fun without having to use the in-game auto select, or help in those times where you just can't make up your mind. It uses [prismic.io](https://prismic.io/) for its data.
